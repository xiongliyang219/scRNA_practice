This is personal practice of scRNA analysis following steps and code in https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial/blob/master/latest_notebook/Case-study_Mouse-intestinal-epithelium_1906.ipynb. Some steps might be modified compared to the original ones. Starting from batch correction, sub-sampled dataset (1/4 of the original size) is used so that it will not take forever to run the code on a personal computer... More detailed explanations for each step can be referred to the original notebook above.
