## Python
This is personal practice of scRNA analysis following steps and code in https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial/blob/master/latest_notebook/Case-study_Mouse-intestinal-epithelium_1906.ipynb. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE92332&format=file. Some steps might be modified compared to the original ones. Starting from batch correction, sub-sampled dataset (1/4 of the original size) is used so that it will not take forever to run the code on an old personal computer... More detailed explanations for each step can be referred to the original notebook above.

## R
As a comparison, scRNA_practice.Rmd analyzes the same dataset using Seurat in R. It includes steps from QC to cluster annotation. The dataset is not sub-sampled here.
